WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/viterbi/01/tongjia/work_gpdk045/LVS/ph3_sytolic_array.gds.gz' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /home/viterbi/01/ee577/CDS_GPDK45/gpdk045_v_5_0/gpdk045/gpdk045.layermap
WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream Out. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-280): The output file will be a compressed file because the file name has extension .gz
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.
