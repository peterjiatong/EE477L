WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream Out. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.

If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip.
